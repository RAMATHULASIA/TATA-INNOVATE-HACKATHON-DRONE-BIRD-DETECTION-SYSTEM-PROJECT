# Generative AI Co-pilot for Embedded Software Design

## Project Overview
This project develops an AI-powered co-pilot system specifically designed for embedded software development in smart vehicles. The system leverages generative AI to assist developers in creating, optimizing, and validating embedded code while considering automotive-specific constraints and requirements.

## Features
- **Intelligent Code Generation**: AI-powered code suggestions for embedded C/C++ and assembly
- **Vehicle Context Awareness**: Understanding of automotive systems, protocols (CAN, LIN, FlexRay)
- **Real-time Constraints**: Code generation with timing and memory constraints
- **Safety Compliance**: AUTOSAR and ISO 26262 compliance checking
- **Multi-platform Support**: Support for various MCUs and automotive ECUs
- **Interactive Development**: CLI and API interfaces for seamless integration
